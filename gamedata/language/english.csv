lore_id_10_text;I took big risks, mad risks, to hear others tell it. I lived like a king one day, a pauper the next. I loved it, every day could be anything, and I knew every poor bit of luck would just make the next taste of good fortune that much sweeter. So, when I heard that the Ancient Dungeon had popped up again, you bet I set out for it that very day. I was off to risk it all, and I could barely hold my bones still for all the excitement of it.
lore_id_10_title;Page 2
lore_id_11_text;I lay the fault of my death at the feet of the Grand Library. After being ousted and vilified for my research by the masters, I was forced to live as an exile in the woods, living on small game and whatever pittance desperate villagers would trade for my “sacrilegious” potions. Such sacrilege was hard work, though, and so it was that, as I scraped moss from a random cavern’s wall, daylight suddenly disappeared with a great cracking noise and I was lost in darkness.
lore_id_11_title;Page 1
lore_id_12_text;Now, I was no great warrior, but I took big swings. I tore through every hall I wandered into, giving as good as I got (and I got quite a bit). The journey was rough, but I was nearly mad with excitement! Gold coins lay about like rubbish, and magical treasures let me do things I couldn't believe. The further I went, the more likely my escape seemed. Big mistake, that. I should have known better. The universe is a fickle sort of thing.
lore_id_12_title;Page 3
lore_id_13_text;I got bigger and stronger and very good at fighting. The new people are my first friends. They give me food and presents. I have a big ax and a bear hat and a little dress. My friends say it is not a dress it is a killed. I did not kill it though because it is just a dress. I did kill the bad people and my friends like me more now. But once I killed one of my friends by mistake and I think that my friends did not like that.

lore_id_1_text;I had it all figured out a long time ago. Other folks, they make big plans, shore up piles of wealth, all thinking it gives them some sort of control on their life.<br>Then those plans fall through, that wealth is snatched away, and they're no better than they started.<br>Not me, though, I saw the world for what it was: a big pile of random chance. No point in fighting it, better to roll right along with it, and enjoy the ride.<br>

lore_id_2001_text;The “sciences”, as defined by my peers and forebears, have been triumphed. The great discoveries have been made, so I turn my attention to those spheres of knowledge yet untouched.<br><br>“Magic”, to use the broadest term.<br><br>My work will surely be spurned by most scholars. Even so, I intend that it will not--cannot--be ignored.
lore_id_2001_title;Page 1
lore_id_2002_text;I feel like an unlucky miner, forever bashing at rock without uncovering the slightest gleam of metal.<br><br>For every bit of sense that I uncover a bucket of nonsense follows. It seems that, much like science, the practitioners of magic are composed of a few brilliant minds whose genius is drowned in a sea of foolish utterances. <br><br>No matter. I will collect all the bits until the truth is plain.
lore_id_2002_title;Page 2
lore_id_2003_text;Day the Seventy-Second of the Third Season, Year 1265<br><br>I have done it. I have worked magic.<br><br>A small thing, perhaps: A single tongue of flame, perched on the end of my fingertip, seemingly “summoned” from nothing.<br><br>I spoke no arcane words, nor drew complex symbols. Simply a singular will, a belief that it could happen...and suddenly it did.
lore_id_2003_title;Page 3
lore_id_2004_text;Day the Third of the Fourth Season, Year 1265<br><br>The strength of my ability seems to vary both according to my “focus” and, oddly, my location.<br><br>Concerning focus, I have observed my flame grows and shrinks in accordance with my vigor. Early morning and midday is ideal.<br><br>Concerning location...I am uncertain. The third larder seems best, producing a flame both large and bright, but I see no reason why. Further study is needed.
lore_id_2004_title;Page 4
lore_id_2005_text;Day the Thirty-First of the First Season, Year 1266<br><br>A breakthrough! Today, after emerging from the larder, a kitchen servant asked, “You lookin’ for the ghost?”<br><br>It seems the servants have long regarded a section of the basement--directly below the larder--to be haunted. Upon investigating the previously unknown location, I found my power accentuated further.<br><br>I am relocating my studies to this area. Greatness awaits.
lore_id_2005_title;Page 5
lore_id_2006_text;Day the Fourth of the Second Season, Year 1266<br><br>After a great deal of effort on my (and my servants’) part, the entirety of my laboratory has been moved to the basement. I have arranged my instruments around the particular point in space where my flame is most brilliant.<br><br>And, truly, that is all. While I have bent my mind towards the working of other magics, a simple flame continues to be the height of my achievement. Certainly I lack some key insight.<br><br>Experimentation has yielded its fruit. Back to the books!
lore_id_2006_title;Page 6
lore_id_2007_text;Day the Eleventh of the Third Season, Year 1266<br><br>How true it is that we all play the fool, both the mighty and the meager!<br><br>The rites and rituals I dismissed as theatrical nonsense early in my studies have proven to be key to working greater magics. In my new location, the movements and incantations specified have wrought a grand variety of wonders.<br><br>It occurs to me now that my records and references must be secured. My discoveries could readily be put to ill use.
lore_id_2007_title;Page 7
lore_id_2008_text;Day the Fifteenth of the First Season, Year 1267<br><br>Nearly two seasons since my last entry, but it seems like a lifetime.<br><br>My mind has been set afire by all that I’ve learned. Where once I mimicked the activity of greater men, I now stand among them, able to create entirely new magics.<br><br>Sadly, I believe I have reached the limits of this particular locus. As such, I am preparing for travel. If “unnatural” phenomena are an earmark of such loci, there are many places to explore.
lore_id_2008_title;Page 8
lore_id_2009_text;Day the Fifth of the Third Season, Year 1268<br><br>Finally! Months of grueling travel with naught to show for it save blisters, but finally success!<br><br>We have not yet arrived at the locus, but I can feel it, like a dry sponge in a sudden rain. I am aglow with the power of this place!<br><br>This evening, once my retinue is asleep, I will conjure a flame to confirm my feelings. This part of the world is rather simple, the locals’ reaction to my abilities could be…unpleasant. 
lore_id_2009_title;Page 9
lore_id_2010_text;You made a mistake, rich man. Poor don’t mean stupid, no more than rich means smart.<br><br>I been all over, seen things, magic things, here and there. Been lookin’ for more, and up you pop, stinkin’ of magic and skulking about for more, just like me.<br><br>You can do it, though, I saw, when you thought no one was about. Gonna get your secrets, rich man, no matter what I gotta do.
lore_id_2010_title;Page 1
lore_id_2011_text;Day the Twenty-Fifth of the Third Season, Year 1268<br><br>It is more than I hoped and worse than I feared.<br><br>The power of this place…is terrifying. I fear that if I were to conjure a breeze, a mountain might topple.<br><br>As such, I will only study this phenomenon. Nothing is apparent to the eyes, but I sense this locus with something keener, some ineffable organ I did not realize I possessed.<br><br>I wonder, do all great men fear their discoveries as I do?
lore_id_2011_title;Page 10
lore_id_2012_text;Just stares and scribbles, all day, for weeks now.<br><br>At nothing! Stares at nothing! Maybe the rich man is a crazy man…or maybe he sees something I don’t.<br><br>I want that book he scribbles in, all full and bursting with magics, I bet. But he keeps it close, sleeps with it under all his silks and velvets.<br><br>Need him to trust me, and know just the way. Play a fool, play a dolt, ‘til he thinks I’m simple as a babe, not like to understand a thing.
lore_id_2012_title;Page 2
lore_id_2013_text;Day the Forty-Fourth of the Fourth Season, Year 1268<br><br>I will be returning to my home soon, with great haste.<br><br>The things I have learned…should not be discovered in such a painfully exposed setting. Though it is more than an impossibility that my company of guides and servants could grasp the merest shred of this place’s truth, the rumors they could spread may bring unwanted attention.<br><br>I will leave in two days with only a single servant. The man is older than I would prefer, but simple-minded enough that I need not fear his observations.
lore_id_2013_title;Page 11
lore_id_2014_text;Dead of night, rich man’s fast asleep, I probably shouldn’t write nothin’ (dumb folks can’t write), but I gotta gloat to somebody, even just myself.<br><br>I should be on a stage, sure as anything! Never thought I was much of an actor, but guess I was wrong. I scrape and gawp and look an absolute fool to anyone looking, for certain!<br><br>The rich man still keeps his secrets close, but I can see him loosening, like drawstrings on a cheap money pouch. Just a matter of time, now…
lore_id_2014_title;Page 3
lore_id_2015_text;Day the Second of the Second Season, Year 1269<br><br>Finally, home.<br><br>My first order of business on returning was to further secure my laboratory. The door has been replaced with a sturdy oak slab covered with iron locks. I make an awful clanging with the keys each morning, but the necessity is clear.<br><br>With some hesitation, I will attempt to apply what I learned abroad here. Caution will be paramount, but this locus must be strengthened if I am to progress my studies safely.
lore_id_2015_title;Page 12
lore_id_2016_text;Thick stone and hearthfire in every corner! Can’t hardly believe it, how rich one man can be and how poor another.<br><br>No bother, though, here I am, cozy as can be. Rich man thinks me an idiot, lets only me down to his lab to serve him his tea and biscuits. Thinks I can’t sus a bit of what I see, but I do. Been writing down every scrap I can recall, see if I can’t make some magic myself!
lore_id_2016_title;Page 4
lore_id_2017_text;Day the Thirty-Ninth of the Second Season, Year 1269<br><br>I have finally managed to strengthen my locus, though “strengthen” may not be the best word for it. “Widen” would be better, as I now believe it to be a “tear” in our reality, with some other reality beyond it.<br><br>Slowly, carefully, I have been plucking at its edges, widening it by almost imperceptible increments. I do perceive it, though, like a faint ray of sunlight on my skin. My power has grown.<br><br>A bit more, then I will stop. The process is intoxicating, but I shall not drink to satisfaction.
lore_id_2017_title;Page 13
lore_id_20_text;I entered the Ancient Dungeon with great optimism and sense of purpose. I had worked hard among my peers, but had never found a chance by which to truly distinguish myself. Then it came: by great luck, another entrance into the Ancient Dungeon had been found within my lifetime. Immediately, I resolved to enter, and, for the first time in human history, map its interior. My life seemed a small thing to risk when weighed against such a tremendous endeavor.
lore_id_20_title;Page 1
lore_id_21_text;My friends took me on a long trip to visit a cave. They said the bad people were inside the cave and said for me to go in. I went in the cave and it was dark and I got lost but I found the bad things and I killed the things. I killed for a long time but there were a lot of bad things. I got very tired and the bad things were hurting me. The bad things hurt me for a long time but then I got sleepy and I went to sleep.
lore_id_21_title;Page 3
lore_id_22_text;So, as you might imagine, when I heard about all the amazing beasties in the Ancient Dungeon…well, I couldn't resist. I made my way there with every instrument and tool I could handle. I planned to study each and every one of them and, if any were nice and soft and non-violent, hug the absolute bejeezus out of it!  The young blacksmith outside the dungeon said my plan was suicide, but that's “people” for you, always trying to put each other down.
lore_id_22_title;Page 2
lore_id_23_text;The debasement of our lowly flesh is the greatest display of a man’s devotion to the divine. Though others of my order suck at their teeth when contemplating the practice, I embraced it whole-heartedly from an early age. Thrice daily I rent the flesh of my back, until the pain of it faded to nearly nothing, entirely overshadowed by the divine joy the practice imparted to me. My devotion did not go unnoticed, and I ascended the ranks of the Divine Order quickly.
lore_id_23_title;Page 1
lore_id_24_text;On my very first day inside, I met Clarence. He was ADORABLE! He followed me around like a gooey little green puppy and he LOVED TO CUDDLE! Every time I turned around he had glommed onto me somewhere, making happy little burbling sounds. Sure, Clarence put some holes in my outfit, but he was just having fun. We made a great team! We spent days and days gathering notes about his friends, watching them, dissecting them…it's really sad it all ended so suddenly.
lore_id_24_title;Page 3
lore_id_2_text;I am not smart, but I am big. I was big when I was little and I was bigger when I was not little. Town people like me when I pick things up for them, but they don't like me when I am hungry. Town people made me leave and I was very hungry. I was alone for a long time but I found new people. The new people have swords and armor and they like to fight bad people. They gave me a sword and let me fight the bad people. I am big and strong and good at fighting.
lore_id_2_title;Page 1
lore_id_30_text;After scrabbling fruitlessly at the earthen walls for a few moments, I decided to explore further into the cave. Led only by touch, I felt earth turn to worked stone, and realized my situation with jarring clarity: I had been ensnared by the Ancient Dungeon. Despite its long absence, the dungeon’s existence was uncontested by the historians of the Grand Library. There was only one great labyrinth known to be churning below the earth, and I was in it.
lore_id_30_title;Page 2
lore_id_31_text;Immediately, problems presented themselves. Not only did the dungeon contain numerous hostile creatures (all of whom I ran from rather than engage), but much worse, the corridors I mapped seemed to wrap and twist among each other like a mass of knotted rope. The further I went, the more inexplicable my map became. After weeks of desperate survival, I became certain of a terrifying truth: the dungeon was moving.
lore_id_31_title;Page 2
lore_id_32_text;It was no surprise when I was selected to eradicate the unholy taint of the Ancient Dungeon. My military prowess was only narrowly surpassed by my faith. I was a formidable foe in battle. As I ventured within that heretical tomb of evil, I felt the thick bed of scars upon my back loosen and warm, as though the divines themselves had draped a blessed shroud upon me. My success was assured, I thought, and so I fought through the halls with zealous abandon.
lore_id_32_title;Page 2
lore_id_33_text;I did not despair: I exulted. Despite all their machinations, the Grand Library could not keep me from great works! With some difficulty, I began gathering up every sprout, fungus, and weed I came across. All were steeped in the magic of the dungeon, and the potions I brewed with them were wondrous! Imbued beyond mortal boundaries, every danger of my new home was inconsequential. I walked the corridors of the Ancient Dungeon without fear, like a lord in his castle. In reality, I was an interloper, and my intrusion did not go unnoticed.
lore_id_33_title;Page 3
lore_id_34_text;I died. I…I don't understand, how could I be dead? I'm the greatest hunter that ever lived! What happened? It's all fuzzy in my head. Okay, okay…just think. I remember digging back into the dungeon…talking to a few idiots who must have lucked their way out…then I got in…and…nothing. Just dead. Wait…WAIT! Did one of those idiots sneak up on me and kill me? That must be it. It's the only way any of this makes sense…
lore_id_34_title;Page 1
lore_id_35_text;I can't believe it, betrayed by a fellow adventurer. I mean, I understand the envy, it must be tough to meet someone so clearly your superior. But murder? Wow, just WOW. Now I suppose I'll need to haunt them or something before I can “move on”, unfinished business and such. Not sure what they look like, though…I guess I'll just look for an adventurer who looks “murdery”. Haunt them for a while, make them see the error of their ways, then off to…somewhere cool, I hope.
lore_id_35_title;Page 2
lore_id_36_text;Dead sucks. Haunting sucks. It's not working. I've spooked at least a dozen murdery-looking adventurer types, and no beautiful, otherworldly light from above to walk into yet. And I…I don't know, it's getting harder to think lately. Makes me tired. If I don't figure this out soon, I'm afraid I'll end up like the other mindless ghosts around here, just floating about and beating on whoever comes along. Hah! I'll be fine. The Hunter always wins!
lore_id_36_title;Page 3
lore_id_37_text;An honest man, in taking stock of what is absolutely necessary for a good life, will find little. Enough food not to suffer hunger, enough shelter not to suffer the elements, enough water not to suffer thirst. The excesses most men indulge in weaken them, bind them up with a thousand “needs” that are truly “wants”. They toil endlessly after them, somehow blind to their utter uselessness. I have long tried to free men from such chains, but they only see a “madman” crying out in the town square. 
lore_id_37_title;Page 1
lore_id_38_text;From then on I abandoned my academic pursuits and focused solely on survival. The risk I had taken would be worth less than nothing if I could not, at least, escape with my life. Though my map was useless, I hoped that the notes I had written concerning the many dangers of the Ancient Dungeon would have some value. I continued with great caution, moving slowly and carefully. Many more weeks passed, but I survived, creeping ever downward, until I finally met…the end.
lore_id_38_title;Page 3
lore_id_39_text;I suffered a thousand-thousand wounds as I progressed, but such ravages were small things to me. I fought and bled for hours, then days, and with each passing moment grew more assured of the divines’ blessing upon me. My fervor was such that I did not notice the gradually slowing of my pace, the softening of my blows…or my increasingly shallow breaths. Even so, I continued to slay until my very last moment, eventually collapsing into a motionless heap, a terrible ghoul freshly skewered by my sword.
lore_id_39_title;Page 3
lore_id_3_text;I've always loved animals. They're just SO MUCH BETTER than people! Some are cute and soft, others ugly and hard, but all of them are AMAZING! I've always spent as much time with animals as I could, sometimes just observing, but also hugging, and smooching, and cuddling them. Even better, when they die (old and happy, of course), you can take them apart and learn SO MUCH! I'll never forget my first dissection, it was magical.
lore_id_3_title;Page 1
lore_id_40_text;True, my appearance is meager, but the peace within me is grand. I could not convince others of the power of my way with mere words, so I sought to put it on display. One day I announced to all that I would venture into the Ancient Dungeon and emerge alive from it. The simple folk there laughed at me and mocked the frailty of my body, certain that I would be slaughtered. I bid them follow me, witness my entrance and, subsequently, my exit. Few followed, but it would have been enough.
lore_id_40_title;Page 2
lore_id_41_text;A life of noble restraint had hardened my constitution and will to iron. The perils presented within the dungeon were nearly inconsequential to me, and I passed them by with a wisdom borne of a lengthy life of deprivation. Amazingly, I came upon food and water with greater ease than ever before, and I ate and drank so steadily I wondered if it were in excess. The creatures within regarded me mostly without interest, and those that pursued I easily evaded. My success seemed assured.
lore_id_41_title;Page 3
luminous_depths;The Luminous Depths
luminous_depths_text;These caves…unbelievable. The air itself shimmers with magic and gigantic glowing crystals pierce the massive stone chambers from floor to ceiling. Small waterfalls cascade into pools of crystal clear water and scatter the soft light . A strange breed of ribbon-like grass sways in unseen winds. It is all terribly strange and beautiful.<br><br>Tch, tch…my words do no justice to this place, but I am happy to be here. I think I will finally sleep well tonight, perhaps even dream.<br><br>Maybe I’ll dream of home.<br><br>

speechbubble_descdendant_blacksmith_tome_choice2_option1;Because the tome is bound in the flesh of your forebears?
speechbubble_descdendant_blacksmith_tome_dialog1;I don't approve.
speechbubble_descdendant_blacksmith_tome_dialog2;No, of this... wand and tome situation. Too magic-y. My great-great-great uncle was mad to construct them.
speechbubble_descdendant_blacksmith_tome_dialog3;What? No! Why would you even think that?
speechbubble_descdendant_blacksmith_tome_end;Sheesh... just get to your adventuring, adventurer. Use the tome if you like. Just be creepy elsewhere.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_augmentshop_choice1_option1;Yes?
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_augmentshop_choice2_option1;Awesome!
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_augmentshop_dialog1;Hold, please, and listen for a moment.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_augmentshop_dialog2;Another like you has blooded The Beast, and my weapons can be strengthened as a result. The blood can change and empower them
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_augmentshop_end;Yes, it can be awe-inspiring. Since you are next to risk your life in that place, I feel it is only right that you decide how the blood is used. I’ve made some plans and posted them near the anvil, please take a look.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_choice1_option1;It's fine, I guess?
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_choice2_option1;Actually, that knife-
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_choice3_option1;...
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_dialog1;How's your eyesight?
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_dialog2;Hmpf. Good enough. Take this crossbow and dagger.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_dialog3;No! It's on... reserve. For... Timothy. The mighty. Timothy the Mighty.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_crossbow_end;Just take the crossbow, okay? Off you go, good luck, yada yada...
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_introduction_choice1_option1;...hello?
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_introduction_choice2_option1;I do.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_introduction_dialog1;...
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_introduction_dialog2;Greetings. You intend to go inside, I take it?
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_introduction_end;So be it. I would warn you away, but I know there is no use in it. Instead, I bid you only to take care. The Ancient Dungeon is a dangerous place.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_1;No, I don’t just stand here all the time! I just do all my forgework while you lot are in the dungeon, lest I be pestered with inane questions!
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_2;The hammer is the first thing my family forged, untold generations ago. It is made of the same stuff as our weapons, but heated differently to make it harder and more durable.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_3;My grandfather’s grandfather completed the knife, and what a shock it gave him when he threw it! Nearly took off his ear when it came soaring back!
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_4;As long as that dungeon has been around, so has my family. We hold it as a sacred duty to forge weapons to aid in its destruction.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_5;The weapons my family forges always make their way back to us, regardless of the wielder’s fate. We don’t really understand it, but we certainly appreciate it.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_6;That acolyte fellow keeps pestering me with “hello” and “good morning” and such. To my mind, silence is better left unbroken...especially in the morning.
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_7;The Ancient Dungeon churns beneath the earth constantly, moving about bit by bit. The last entrance found was nearly 500 miles southeast of here!
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_8;Last night, I dreamed that the dungeon spoke to me. Odd, and more odd still, I swear it sounded familiar...
speechbubble_descendant_blacksmith_rand_9;I've heard tell that there are “merchants” in the dungeon, selling oddments. Be wary, friend: anything that lives in that place surely means you harm.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_cradle_talk;Good luck, adventurer…heck, great luck, the absolute best luck! Now... I'm off to take a nap.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_fl_part1;Sure, I could have practiced with my sword a bit more before going in. Sure, I could have packed some food. But would that have really made any difference?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_fl_part2;Maybe. Maybe not. That's the problem with luck, good or bad: you never know exactly how much you'll get and how much you'll need. Even years of preparation might be one day too little.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_fl_part3;I'm glad we got to talk, it helped me get a few things straight in my head. I had a bit of doubt in the back of my mind, and now it's gone. I feel lighter.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_og_part1;So, I came across a big suit of armor lumbering around a room with a big sword. It was pretty slow, so I figured I could just, you know, “duck and weave” my way to destroying the thing.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_og_part2;I ducked. I wove. I hit it. It just refused to...die? Disanimate? Anyway, I was getting tired and it was too late to run away. My hits got weaker, my movements slower and...
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_og_part3;Okay, I'll say it: it lopped my noggin clean off, despite my hair being extremely well-coiffed. Just plain bad luck, that.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_tc_part1;Wow, that was exhausting just to watch! You got a few lucky hits in, just enough, I'd wager. All the same, what a show
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_tc_part2;Sheesh, I really am tired! I can't remember ever being this tired. Lucky me, though, it looks like there's a nice, comfy bed over yonder, just past that light...
speechbubble_ghost_id_1000_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost is clearly smirking, and gives you a knowing wink as you consider it.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_cradleTalk;All the same, I thank you, adventurer. I can finally rest.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_fl_part1;A gigantic yellow eye opened in front of me, glowing fiercely with an inward light that fully revealed its terrible form.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_fl_part2;A massive, fleshy orb with a single eye and a toothy, gaping maw. Every bit of me wanted to run, but something more than just fear kept me still.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_fl_part3;I could not scream when it bit into me. I could not weep for the loss of my simple, foolish life.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_og_part1;After so much wandering, I was almost glad to find no way forward. I had lowered myself into a pit, a cliff on one side, an abyss on the other.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_og_part2;It was quiet, and dark, and still. I sat on the ledge and stared into that blackness for minutes on end…
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_og_part3;…until something stared back.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_tc_part1;I died for a chance to make a mark on the world, on history. Now, I wonder about that choice. What's wrong with a small life, well-lived and unnoticed?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_tc_part2;I was not the first to die in such a manner, and I won't be the last. It is a strange kind of madness.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1001_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost looks at you with a sad smile on its face, and gives a little wave in greeting.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_cradleTalk;Ew. That gave me a shiver. I'm sure there are animals. Dogs, at the very least.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_fl_part1;It's my fault, really. Animals do things based on instinct, not on rational thought. I just forget that sometimes, what with them being so cute and amazing.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_fl_part2;I mean, if Clarence had thought about how much we meant to each other, I'm sure he wouldn't have eaten a hole into my skull.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_fl_part3;At least I know he doesn't feel guilty. He probably just feels…full, I guess.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_og_part1;I really think every negative interaction is the result of poor communication. I prided myself on understanding what animals tried to communicate, but…sometimes I was wrong.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_og_part2;I was wrong with Clarence. Clarence wasn't cuddly, he was hungry. I went to sleep with him burbling in my hair one night…and, well, he burbled a hole right through it.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_og_part3;On the bright side, at least Clarence isn't hungry anymore. I really hope he gets to grow up and be big and strong like all his friends.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_tc_part1;Hey, thanks for hearing me out. In all honesty, I think I was feeling a bit…resentful towards Clarence. But he was just being him. Cute, amazing, and dangerously acidic.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_tc_part2;Time for me to go. Do you think there are any animals on the other side? I hope so. If not, I suppose I could give “people” a chance.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1010_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost's eyes scan you up and down, drinking in every detail. You have a feeling it very much wants to poke you.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_cradleTalk;And remember! Be careful, no matter what. A bit of fear can be a good thing, keeps you safe.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_fl_part1;I think I remember now. I didn't die from some murdery adventurer. I think it was a skeleton. A stupid skeleton.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_fl_part2;I wasn't being careful. I figured nothing could touch me. Ya know…being The Hunter, and all. Kinda dumb of me.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_fl_part3;Hey, you be careful, though! I wouldn't want what happened to me to happen to you.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_og_part1;Oh…hey. Looks like one of you adventurers knocked my senses back into me. Weird…can't see how anyone could have beat me.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_og_part2;Well, I suppose if they were, like, the GREATEST adventurer ever, they might have beat me. That must be it…right?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_og_part3;Well…uh, good luck and all. Hope you survive. Being a ghost isn't much fun.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_tc_part1;Wow, that was great. Really awesome. If I hadn't been so big-headed, maybe I could've done something like that.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_tc_part2;I feel better now. Ready to move on. I can't thank you enough.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1011_unlockRunPart;<i>A grimace is clearly evident on the ghost's vague features as it gazes at you, but the apparition remains still.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_cradleTalk;Good night friend.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_fl_part1;I think that we are friends now. You are not mean to me like the town people so we are friends. Hello new friend.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_fl_part2;I am happy. I was alone and very scared and very sad but now I have a new friend. You are strong like me but not big like me.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_fl_part3;I promise I will not make a mistake and kill you.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_og_part1;I am awake now but my friends are gone and I am lost. The bad things don't hurt me now but I am still scared because I am alone.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_og_part2;Can you be my friend? I will not ask for food because I am not hungry anymore. I will try not to make a mistake.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_og_part3;I am angry at me because I made a mistake and killed my friend.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_tc_part1;That bad thing was big and scary but I was not scared because you are so strong. Thank you for killing the scary bad thing.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_tc_part2;I am sleepy again. I can see a warm spot now and I think it will be a nice place to sleep so I am going to sleep.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1020_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost has stopped attacking you, but with obvious difficulty. It lunges toward you every now and then, but manages to restrain itself.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_cradleTalk;Whatever your aims in this terrible place are, I wish you the best, adventurer
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_fl_part1;Perhaps the Grand Library had cause to discourage and condemn my alchemical pursuits. Had previous members been similarly doomed by their creations?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_fl_part2;In all, it is better that I died within the Ancient Dungeon than above. May my work be forever buried and undisturbed.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_fl_part3;You, though, if you happen to come across one of my dreadful concoctions, take heed of my warning and let it be.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_og_part1;The idea began as a passing thought, but ended as a nearly unshakable impulse. I desperately wanted–and did not want–to venture deeper, to…meet something.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_og_part2;My mind was being assaulted, and I defended myself as best I could. I brewed potions to fortify my mind, gulping them down without regard to possible dangers.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_og_part3;I was…successful? My magical “cocktail” quelled the dreadful impulse, but it also drove me quite insane. Owing to that, I cannot recall the exact circumstances of my death.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_tc_part1;As has ever been said, men concern themselves too often with what they can do rather than what they should do. May you be spared such folly.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_tc_part2;Now then–my heart is lightened and my mind is clear. I will proceed as befits the dead.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1021_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost's face is an expression of barely-contained glee, save for when a violent twitch occasionally warps it into a terrifying rictus.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_cradleTalk;Adventurer, I thank you for your company and conversation. Divines’ blessings be upon you.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_fl_part1;Yes…yes…it is pride. Imagine, to think one’s self so grand as to merit a glimpse at the divine plan!
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_fl_part2;I must repent, but with my flesh now gone, I am unpracticed in an appropriate ritual. Pain will purge me, but what sort?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_fl_part3;I think…I will meditate on my folly. Hone the edge of that memory until the shame of it cuts as deeply as any blade.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_og_part1;I cannot understand the divine purpose of my death, but even now I acknowledge it as true and right.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_og_part2;The grand design is imperceptible to mortals, but even so, I do wish that I could contemplate that portion concerning my passing.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_og_part3;Is that why I remain? Have I kindled the flame of sin within myself by harboring such a desire?
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_tc_part1;Ah, pain! Ah, delight! Ah, redemption! Thank you, divines! I am enlightened, ascended!
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_tc_part2;My soul has been humbled just as my body once was, and I can feel the other side now open to me. I will depart.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1030_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost looks at you square in the eye for a few moments before giving a reluctant nod of acknowledgement.</i>
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_cradleTalk;You have listened to me, though, and, perhaps, learned from me. That is enough, and enough is plenty.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_fl_part1;Why do I wander still? Why am I not at rest? Long have I pondered that question, adventurer.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_fl_part2;Ah…no matter…it is an unexpected delight to converse a bit. I did not realize until now that I missed it.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_fl_part3;Apologies, I ramble. I am…unused to considering another’s concerns…
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_og_part1;I lived within the Ancient Dungeon for nearly thirty-two years before dying peacefully in my sleep. I stayed there, not because I was lost, but because I was happy.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_og_part2;The solitude, the simplicity of my existence with the dungeon delighted me beyond words, and I could not bring myself to leave.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_og_part3;True, I would be viewed as a failure by the world without…but such concerns are also excess.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_tc_part1;Hello adventurer, and thank you. With your help, I have discovered what has kept me from a true rest.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_tc_part2;It was guilt. I abandoned humanity when I chose to reside here, and so denied it the opportunity to learn my ways. I am ashamed.
speechbubble_ghost_id_1031_unlockRunPart;<i>The ghost silently considers you, expressionless, but you somehow feel as though you are being judged.</i>

speechbubble_ngplus_adventurer_wins_0_part1;Hah! That thing booted you out here too, right?
speechbubble_ngplus_adventurer_wins_0_part2;A handy trick, that. Anything seems too nasty, just poof it away. Won’t stop me, though. I’ve never failed a hunt, and won’t start now.
speechbubble_ngplus_adventurer_wins_0_part3;Bashing my way back inside! Figure it’ll be quicker than finding my way back to the entrance, considering I have no idea where we are.

speechbubble_studious_acolyte_hardmode_dialog1;You! You look...TOUGH! Too tough, in fact. The dungeon will be nothing more than a stroll for you! Care to...make it interesting?
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_hardmode_dialog2;YES! Now listen: I’ve discovered a certain scent that is irresistible to creatures within the dungeon. If you were to give yourself a bit of a spritz...well, a true “adventure” would be guaranteed!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_hardmode_end;Of course you do! Well, get to it then! I left a bottle near the entrance, spritz with WILD ABANDON!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_choice1_option1;Uh...sure...
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_choice2_option1;Gross.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_choice3_option1;...sure…
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_dialog1;You! You look decisive. If you could spare a moment, I would be grateful.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_dialog2;Wonderful, the problem is this: due to the mountain of data provided by other adventurers like yourself, I find myself afflicted with *ahem* ANALYSIS PARALYSIS!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_dialog3;Don’t be vulgar. And LISTEN! I cannot decide which research to search, every option is equally delectable! Please, PLEASE, choose for me!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_insightshop_end;THANK YOU! Just select a topic on the board to my right, quick as you can. I am BRIMMING with academic energies that must be spent!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_introduction_choice1_option1;Very.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_introduction_choice2_option1;You’re going to watch?
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_introduction_dialog1;Greetings! You are the very first adventurer to arrive! Excited?
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_introduction_dialog2;As am I, excited indeed to observe your attempt...er..success, I mean.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_introduction_end;Yes, using the scrying glass here. I will be making copious notes in order to advance the research of The Grand Library. BUT ENOUGH! Less talk, more questionable life choices! In you go! Good luck!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_0;Little known fact: it was I who discovered this entrance. All it took was perseverance, research, and getting very, very lost on a hike.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_1;The Grand Library can be a harsh master, but it’s worth it! After only four years of grueling labor and a decade of exorbitant payments, I’m a shoe-in for middle management!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_2;Hey, if you find yourself in mortal danger with no way out down there, please consider throwing yourself into a pit. No one has done that yet.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_3;Which do you like better, “slime” or “jelly”? I’m leaning towards “jelly”, but that may be because it’s time for my snack.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_4;You adventurers always seem to arrive at night, why is that? Skin condition? Night owl? Vampire?! (You know you have to tell me if you’re a vampire, right?)
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_5;I think I may finally be winning the blacksmith over! This morning--and I swear this is true--he grunted at me when I said “good morning”! Progress!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_6;Don’t look at me with those “come-hither” eyes! I am wed to Lady Knowledge and shall never be unfaithful! Now shoo!
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_7;I asked the blacksmith to critique a bit of my work and he called my handwriting “chicken-scratch”! CHICKEN SCRATCH! We’re no longer on speaking terms.
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_8;Don’t tell anyone, but sometimes I switch between blue ink and black ink! The Grand Library would be scandalized, but what’s life without a bit of excitement?
speechbubble_studious_acolyte_rand_9;I can’t keep this secret anymore, the guilt is too much! I draw horizontal rules on my parchment before writing in ink, and then erase the pencil! My impeccable penmanship is a lie! A dirty, dirty lie!
speechbubble_talk;Talk
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_0;It was a long, cold journey for me, best I warm myself by the fire a bit before going in.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_1;I woke up this morning with a terrible headache. Once it passes, I’ll head inside directly.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_2;Ooof, I think I ate something bad. I suppose I’ll have to delay my adventure until it settles.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_3;Did you see that black cat? It’s an ill omen. Perhaps not the best day for adventuring...
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_4;I slept terribly last night! Alertness is key when willfully endangering one’s life, so no Ancient Dungeon for me today.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_5;Today is my birthday, so I’m celebrating by not entering the Ancient Dungeon.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_6;I stepped in a puddle and now I have soggy socks. A person just can’t adventure in soggy socks. Hopefully they’ll be dry by tomorrow.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_7;I was going to go inside today, but a dog just ate my homework. I know the two seem unrelated, but trust me, they’re not.
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_8;Ouch! Paper cuts are the absolute worst! Right on my sword-thumb too! I hope it heals quickly so I can finally go inside.. *unconvincing sigh*
speechbubble_the_craven_rand_9;No no, you first, I insist! I may not be the greatest adventurer around, but I pride myself on my manners. I’m happy to wait for my turn.
